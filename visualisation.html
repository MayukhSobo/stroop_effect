                <p> The two pi charts above shows the percentage share of the scores
                of congruent and incongruent. Even in the pi chart it is visible that 
                the congruent one has more percentage share in the lower intervals as 
                comapred to the incongruent one. This is obvbious because on an average
                congruent test should take lesser time than incongruent one. For example
                <em> only 4% of 20 to 25</em> range while only <em> 0% of more than 25 </em> 
                are in congruent test while <em> more than 60% </em> are in the incongruent
                list for these intervals. </p>

				<p> This is the comparison of the congruent and incongruent scores for each indivisuals. It can be observed that
						the value of the congruent scores in <span id="orange"> ORANGE </span> is lesser than all the incongruent scores
						colored in <span id="green"> GREEN </span>. This is the obvious situation because people would naturally take less
						time for pronouncing the congruent words as compared to incongruent ones. This also shows that there is no ouliers
						in the data although later displayed scatter plot would reveal it more. All the data is taken form the csv file given for the project. <em> Drag on the interactive graph below to zoom in. If you are on touch screen device then, pinch out to zoom in and vice versa. Tablets are best device to interact with the graph however this is
						not necessary always. </em>
