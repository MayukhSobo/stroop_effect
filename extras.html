				 Participants spent almost 36% less time reading the <span id="orange"> CONGRUENT</span> words as compared to <span id="green"> INCONGRUENT </span> words. 
			</div></h3><br>
			<h3><div class="wow zoomIn center">
				 This test would have been more fun if the word were given are all <span id="green"> INCONGRUENT</span> but the two test groups are males and female only. This would result in finding if both males and females took same time or they took different times. Probably a 2 tailed Hypothesis test between their mean scores would be helpful.

				 See if this effect is still this effective if there are no words but only digits.

			<h3><div class="wow zoomIn center">
				 How effective this test would be if we take all children who can read the words but can not relate these with colors!

				 A peep into <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/words.html">this</a> page reveals that some other alternatives of the stroop test like using non color words or using emotional words.

			<h3><div class="wow zoomIn center">
				 One final thing that could be really interesting is that mixing <span id="orange">CONGRUENT</span> and <span id="green"> INCONGRUENT </span> words and how participants quickly switch their attention. This can be used to test the learning reflex of the them.
