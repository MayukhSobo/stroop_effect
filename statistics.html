        The dependent variable is the time taken by all the participants because their
        time was dependent on the independent variable of the test. All the statical clculations are based on the evaluation of the dependent variable and hence all the conclusions too. </p>

        <h2> <div class="wow zoomIn"> Hypothesis and Justifications !!</div> </h2>
        <div class="wow zoomIn"> 
        	<p> There are several types of Hypothesis Analysis. This is appropriate if we evaluate the mean of both the groups; i.e. Congruent and Incongruent. Basically we would like to know if incongruent words affects our reading abilities because of semantic interference. There are no information given about the samples other than their congruent and incongruent scores. So we would assume that these samples are randomly choosen which means that the participants are of different age, both male and female and of different education level. In this scenario, our hypothesis would be that giving incongruent words is statistically siginificant or not. In this context our <em> NULL Hypothesis</em> is that there is no significant difference in the time between congruent and incongruent scores while the <em> ALTERNATIVE hypothesis </em> is that there would be a significant difference. Also we dont have any statistics of the complete population for their congruent and incongruent socres and hence we would assume and evaluate the metrics of the sample and then try to extrapolate it on the population which means we wwould basically use <em> one tailed and two tailed t-tests</em> to evaluate how significant the incongruent words are on the time taken. We would also give a 95% confidence interval. r-squared value is also given to understand that fact how much variation in the time between both the test is due to stroop effect.</p>
